Hello, I am KIKI, currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computational and Modeling Science at **Tsinghua University**. I am focused on using machine learning to solve PDEs (Partial Differential Equations). Besides this, I also write about applications of machine learning. If you are interested in these topics, feel free to contact me.
